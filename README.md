## Data Collection

The dataset for this analysis was obtained from Kaggle's [Indian YouTube Trending Videos](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/datasnaek/youtube-new?select=INvideos.csv) dataset. This dataset contains information about videos that trended on YouTube in India, including video titles, descriptions, categories, view counts, likes, comments, and more.

## Data Analysis

We utilized Python's data analysis libraries to process and analyze the Kaggle dataset. This involved data cleaning, visualization, sentiment analysis, and categorization of video types. The Jupyter Notebook used for the analysis can be found [here](http://localhost:8888/notebooks/Trending%20YouTube%20Video%20Statistics/Indian%20Youtube%20Trending%20Video%20Analysis.ipynb).

## Key Findings

Our analysis revealed several interesting insights:
- Most popular video categories in India
- Correlation between likes, comments, and views
- The impact of video duration on trending
- Common keywords in trending video titles
- How many views do our trending videos have? Do most of them have a large number of views? Is having a large number of views required 
   for a video to become trending?
- The same questions above, but applied to likes and comment count instead of views.
- Which video remained the most on the trendin-videos list?
- How many trending videos contain a fully-capitalized word in their titles?
- What are the lengths of trending video titles? Is this length related to the video becoming trendy?
- How are views, likes, dislikes, comment count, title length, and other attributes correlate with (relate to) each other? How are they 
  connected?
- What are the most common words in trending video titles?
- Which YouTube channels have the largest number of trending videos?
- Which video category (e.g. Entertainment, Gaming, Comedy, etc.) has the largest number of trending videos?
